## Key Performance Indicators
KPIs serve as crucial benchmarks for businesses, offering specific, measurable values tracking progress towards significant objectives. They function akin to a dashboard, elucidating a company's performance on its trajectory to success. By adhering to these KPIs, businesses can make informed decisions based on tangible data and pinpoint areas necessitating improvement.

### Calculated Measured KPIs
A calculated measured Key Performance Indicator (KPI) quantifies metrics derived through specific formulas to systematically evaluate performance. It entails strategically computing data points to gauge progress or success against predefined objectives or benchmarks.

1. **Hiring Measures**
   - Total number of hires
   - Number of female hires
   - Number of male hires

2. **Promotion Measures**
   - Total number of promotions
   - Number of female promotions
   - Number of male promotions

3. **Performance and Turnover Measures**
   - Total turnover
   - Turnover by females
   - Turnover by males

## Insights and Recommendations
- The executive and senior management tiers exhibit a lack of diversity, predominantly comprising males. This hints at potential biases in the hiring and promotion processes, contributing to gender imbalance.
- Promotion trends indicate a stark gender disparity, with a majority being awarded to males. Addressing this requires conducting surveys and fostering career growth opportunities for female employees to bolster diversity and nurture a healthier work environment.
- Male employees, particularly in executive roles, showcase a higher turnover rate, correlating with below-target performance ratings. Implementing feedback mechanisms and offering incentives can mitigate turnover, thereby enhancing retention rates.
- Analysis reveals a notable turnover rate, with distinct patterns observed across different hierarchical levels. While turnover remains consistent in junior roles, it escalates for males in senior positions, necessitating targeted retention strategies.
